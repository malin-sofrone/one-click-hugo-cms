Instead of presenting projects, I ask my teammates to do it — even if they’re a bit uncomfortable. I now gently nudge my reports to share knowledge with the rest of the UX team through talks, mentorship, or workshops. I coach them on being a good mentor instead of mentoring myself.



It took a while to recognize these intangible efforts as a key part of my job. I frequently ask myself, “What did I do this week to unblock or align the people on my team?.” Lately, the answers have become clearer:



Give actionable feedback: It’s a real skill to unblock someone with a particularly difficult UI or UX challenge.

Active listening: Sometimes the most valuable thing I can do is be a sounding board for other people’s great ideas, and ask questions that will lead to clearer actions or decisions.
